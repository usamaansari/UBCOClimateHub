      'Working with Dogwood to get a Local Power team together to encourage the transition off fossil fuel energy sources and to create energy independence,  both for individuals and to support the municipality to set policy and programs to support the same in our region. I am looking for individuals interested in changing their home heating, water heating or appliance use from gas to electric or interested in renewable power generation (ie: solar or geo-thermal). The goal would be to provide cost savings to residents by doing this as a Community Renewables and Retrofit project with partner contractors and to provide low to no-cost financing options to assist. Organizing this will take considerable work so having project management, research, data analysis (would love to do a cost comparison of different systems), outreach and communications support would be amazing!',
